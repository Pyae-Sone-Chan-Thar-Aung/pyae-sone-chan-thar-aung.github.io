        <!--  Reflection content here -->
        <p>The seminar titled <em>"Bridging Academia and Startup Innovation"</em> led by Ceasar Ian Benablo was a powerful and eye-opening session that challenged us to rethink the purpose and potential of our academic research. His talk resonated deeply, especially as it addressed the all-too-common mindset that research is simply a requirement for graduation — something to be completed, hardbound, submitted, and then forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Benablo encouraged us to look beyond graduation and emphasized that thesis writing and research should serve as stepping stones toward real-world impact and innovation. He presented a clear and practical framework that includes research, prototyping, customer validation, and utilization. This process showed us that research should not just end with compliance but should evolve into something applicable, relevant, and beneficial to society.</p>

<p>It was inspiring to learn about the support provided by institutions like the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in promoting technology transfer and commercialization. The fact that the Philippines currently ranks 53rd out of 133 countries in the Global Innovation Index was both surprising and encouraging. Mr. Benablo stressed the importance of adopting a technopreneurial mindset—one that blends academic knowledge with entrepreneurial thinking to drive innovation forward.</p>

<p>What I appreciated most was his message directed at students: the future of innovation starts with us. He urged us, especially those from Davao, to actively participate in the local startup ecosystem and to treat our research not as an endpoint, but as the beginning of real-world solutions. This seminar served as a wake-up call and left me feeling inspired to turn ideas into impact.</p>
