        <!-- Reflection content here -->
        <p>On May 30, 2025, all second-year college students from the College of Computer Studies (CCS) participated in an educational tour at the PTV Mindanao Media Hub in Talomo, Davao. The Mindanao Media Hub operates under the Presidential Communications Office and is home to key government media agencies such as the People’s Television Network, Radyo Pilipinas, the Philippine News Agency, and the Philippine Information Agency. The visit provided us with a valuable opportunity to explore the actual working environment of a multimedia and broadcasting facility.</p>

<p>Our tour began on the ground floor at the News Broadcasting Hall. There, we witnessed live broadcasting activities, observed how the production team worked behind the scenes, and participated in a Q&A session with the officer-in-charge. We also had the chance to take pictures and interact directly with the staff, which gave us insights into how communication and technical teams collaborate during news productions.</p>

<p>Next, we proceeded to the second floor, where we explored the studio and audio control room. We met skilled audio engineers who introduced us to the advanced technologies used for video and audio production. Inside the studio control room, we learned about the systems and processes involved in live broadcasting, recording, and editing. These technical explanations were very enlightening and helped us appreciate the complexity and coordination required in multimedia production.</p>

<p>Although we were not allowed to enter the third-floor server control room, we still got a glimpse of the server setup and observed how the infrastructure was organized. The tour concluded with a group photo taken alongside the PTV Mindanao staff before heading back to our university. This educational tour was not only memorable but also eye-opening—it gave me a broader understanding of the multimedia field and showed how it connects with our studies in Computer Science in ways that go beyond the classroom.</p>
