        <p>
          Reflecting on the seminar led by Mr. Hizon Caja on his team’s capstone project, "TherapEase: Building & Fostering Therapy Collaboration for Therapist and Carer," I found myself both impressed and inspired. The project is a powerful reminder of how technology can truly make lives better—especially for children with developmental delays and their caregivers. TherapEase is more than just a mobile app; it’s a thoughtfully designed tool that bridges the gap between therapists and parents. The features like digital therapy materials, video conferencing, messaging, and even a navigation map highlight how much the developers prioritized real-world needs. I was especially impressed by the ability to download therapy materials for offline use—a small detail that shows deep empathy for users who may lack consistent internet access.

          Hearing about the development process was just as enlightening. Built with Flutter and Node.js and developed using an iterative design approach, the team ran into several real-world challenges—unresponsive therapy centers, backend limitations, and serious time constraints. But what stood out most was their perseverance. Mr. Hizon candidly shared the emotional ups and downs they went through as a team—at one point almost fighting, but also growing closer through laughter and collaboration. It was refreshing to see such honesty and humanity in a technical project.

          What really resonated with me was Mr. Hizon’s reflections on personal growth. He mentioned how he improved not just technically, but also in soft skills like resilience and communication. It reminded me that success in projects isn’t just about writing clean code—it’s about how well we work with others and adapt under pressure. His advice for future capstone students was gold: start early, be led by curiosity—not just deadlines—and document everything. Communication, honesty, and mutual support within the team were emphasized as key ingredients to success.

          In the end, the TherapEase seminar wasn't just a showcase of an app; it was a heartfelt story of growth, problem-solving, and meaningful work. I walked away feeling more prepared and motivated for my own future capstone journey. It reminded me that the best tech projects are those that come from a genuine desire to help—and that the journey, with all its stress and struggles, is just as important as the final product.
