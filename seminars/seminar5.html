        <p>
          The seminar led by Mrs. Shenna was a crucial learning opportunity for us, especially as we prepare to undertake our own research projects in Systems Analysis and Design (SAD) and Software Engineering (SE) in our third year. It was not only a technical briefing but also an ethical and procedural guide on how to approach, design, and implement our future capstone projects. One of the core components discussed was the proper documentation of the routing form, which plays a vital role in project proposal approval and serves as a formal outline of the research scope, timeline, and process. Mrs. Shenna emphasized that this form must be filled out with accuracy and foresight, as it reflects the preparedness and structure of the research team.

          She walked us through the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — from planning and development to testing and deployment — highlighting how each phase should be approached with careful documentation and validation. She underlined the importance of using validated questionnaires, and if any instruments are adopted from other studies, proper citations and acknowledgments are required to maintain academic integrity. She introduced frameworks such as UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), which are often used to design and validate questionnaires related to technology adoption. These models help ensure that user feedback is grounded in theoretical relevance. Mrs. Shenna also presented an inspiring example from a 2022 alumni group’s capstone project called Repro, an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer questions related to sexual health. The presentation included a live demonstration of the Repro web app, where she showcased its functionality and design. This case study served as a practical application of all the concepts she discussed, showing how SDLC, user interface design, testing, and ethical research can come together to produce a socially impactful digital solution.

          What stood out most in the seminar was the in-depth discussion on the ethical dimensions of research. Mrs. Shenna stressed that researchers must go beyond technical excellence and ensure their work upholds ethical standards. Key topics included: informed consent from participants, the vulnerability of research participants—especially in sensitive topics, managing risk particularly discomfort from lengthy questionnaires or emotional triggers due to personal or traumatic experiences, ensuring privacy and confidentiality in data handling, upholding justice, transparency, and fairness, and demonstrating the qualifications of the researchers along with the adequacy of facilities for proper project implementation. She also reminded us of the importance of obtaining the research and ethics committee certificate prior to testing—a critical procedural step that validates the project's ethical readiness.

          Furthermore, Mrs. Shenna stressed that the user guidelines must be clearly defined as part of the project’s scope and limitations. This helps manage user expectations and delineates the functional boundaries of the application. Lastly, two practical pieces of advice resonated strongly with me: "Manage your time well" and "Manage your group well." These may seem simple, but they are essential for the success of any collaborative research or development project. Time management ensures progress and prevents burnout, while effective group management fosters a productive and respectful team environment. Overall, this seminar provided not only a checklist of technical tasks but also a comprehensive framework of values and best practices that will guide us through our upcoming research journey. It reminded me that research is not merely about building systems — it’s about building meaningful, ethical, and impactful solutions that serve people and communities.
