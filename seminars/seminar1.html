      <div class="content-section">
        <p>Attending the seminar titled "Navigating Software Development in the Industry," presented by Mr. Ned Isaiah Palacios, was a truly eye-opening experience. As a fellow computer science student at the University of the Immaculate Conception, hearing the story of someone who once sat where I am now was both inspiring and comforting. Mr. Ned started his presentation with a relatable title, "A Day in the Life of a Software Developer," and from that moment, I felt an instant connection. He's currently a part-time Python Junior Engineer at Norg.ai and an alumnus of our university. Seeing someone who walked the same corridors and attended the same classes now thriving in the industry made his journey feel tangible and achievable.</p>
          
          <p>The first part of his talk focused on how he got to where he is now. He emphasized the importance of joining local community clubs and volunteering in events, specifically mentioning his involvement in the Developer Student Clubs (DSC) and DICE – a tech community for students to collaborate and work together. It was fascinating to hear how a casual conversation with an Australian developer at a DICE event led to a job offer the next morning. This made me realize how powerful networking can be. One simple interaction can completely change the course of one's career. He also shared how challenging it was to adapt to the LangChain Ecosystem when he first started. Despite the initial struggle, he eventually managed to grasp it, proving that perseverance and a willingness to learn are key. Interestingly, he spoke candidly about his job interview experience – how he was 20 minutes late due to traffic and how his demo project, EMMA (an AI chatbot for the university handbook), didn't work. Despite these setbacks, he showcased his GitHub portfolio, and that became his saving grace. This anecdote was both humorous and encouraging. It reminded me that failure doesn't mean the end; it's just a part of the process.</p>
          
          <p>In the second part of his talk, Mr. Ned shed light on what he does at Norg.ai. He mentioned the daily stand-up meetings, managing pending tickets, and the importance of communication within a tech company. His emphasis on the phrase "developers = more than just coding" struck a chord. It's easy to think that being a developer is all about writing perfect lines of code, but he emphasized how crucial communication, teamwork, and time management are in real-world projects. The tools he uses in his day-to-day work – Postman for testing REST APIs, Microsoft Azure for cloud deployment, GitHub for source code management, and communication tools like Slack and Discord – gave me a clearer picture of what to expect when working in the industry. Hearing him say that ChatGPT Pro has become one of his go-to resources for advice also showed how AI is becoming an integral part of a developer's toolkit.</p>
          
          <p>Towards the end, he highlighted some key industry trends, such as AI, skills-based hiring, and the rise of freelance and remote work. His final takeaways – build to learn and showcase your skills, embrace the community, and stay informed about emerging trends – felt like a checklist for my own journey as a student preparing to step into the tech world. The Q&A session was lively, and it was heartening to see how open and approachable Mr. Ned was in sharing both his achievements and his mistakes. As the seminar concluded with the presentation of a certificate and a group photo, I felt more motivated than ever to keep building my portfolio, participate in community events, and embrace every learning opportunity that comes my way. Overall, the seminar was not only informative but also deeply personal and inspiring. It reminded me that the journey to becoming a software developer is not just about mastering code but also about mastering connections, communication, and a resilient mindset.</p>
