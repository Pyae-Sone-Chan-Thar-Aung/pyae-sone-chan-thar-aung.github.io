          <p>The seminar titled "Research 101: Conference Presentation and Funding Techniques," held on May 22, 2025, and led by Mr. Cris John David R. Moreno, was truly an enriching experience that transformed my perception of research.
            At the beginning of the session, Mr. Moreno asked a simple but telling question: "Who loves research?" Most of us smiled awkwardly, unsure of how to respond. He understood the hesitation; research can feel intimidating, especially when you're flooded with so many studies and concepts. But his down-to-earth and enthusiastic approach made the subject more approachable. He talked about how AI tools like SciSpace have revolutionized research, making it more efficient and manageable. This was a big relief to hear. It felt encouraging to know that we’re no longer navigating this complex journey alone—there are tools out there to help us at every step.
            One of the key takeaways was the importance of identifying the problem first before creating a system or a solution. Many researchers fall into the trap of designing a system they already have in mind and then trying to force-fit a problem into it. Mr. Moreno emphasized that research should come from real issues—not assumptions or personal preferences—and should be backed by data and evidence.
          He also talked about the mindset shift we need as student researchers. It’s easy to fall into negative self-talk or feel overwhelmed by the pressure to produce something academically impressive. But he reminded us that our work has meaning and impact beyond just fulfilling school requirements.
            Mr. Moreno walked us through the roadmap for submitting research for conferences and securing funding. The process starts with ideation and the creation of an abstract. He was honest about how challenging this can be—how having too many ideas can paralyze you. But he also gave a clear strategy: identify real problems supported by existing research and fill in the gaps. And most importantly, love the topic you’re researching. Passion fuels persistence.</p>
            <p>Another practical part of his talk was about budget planning. He mentioned how money can be a real motivator—something most of us wouldn’t admit out loud. But it’s true. Funding is part of the research process, and knowing how to prepare a budget that includes equipment, travel, and operational costs is crucial.
            He also discussed the importance of sustainability—your project shouldn’t just end after it’s completed. It should continue to benefit the community. He introduced us to the DOST and their priority areas, and even explained how to integrate Gender and Development (GAD) into our proposals.
            When it came to presenting research, Mr. Moreno gave valuable advice: your first few seconds matter, and confidence is key. He reminded us that presenting is not about sounding smart—it’s about delivering a message. His three main areas for presentation—content, slide design, and delivery—were broken down into easy-to-understand tips. For example, avoid jargon, structure your ideas logically, use clear visuals, and most of all, practice. Don’t read slides word-for-word. Make eye contact. Be human.
            He even showed us one of his own creative projects that linked emotions to color—a great reminder that originality and personal touch can go a long way in making your research memorable.
            Finally, he talked about handling questions from panelists. Stay calm. Clarify if needed. Be honest if you don’t know the answer. These small but powerful reminders helped me realize that being real and prepared beats trying to appear perfect.
            Overall, the session wasn’t just about how to submit research and get funding. It was about how to enjoy and believe in the process. Research isn't just about papers and publications; it’s about solving real-world problems and contributing something meaningful. Mr. Moreno made that message loud and clear—and I walked away feeling more confident, curious, and excited about my own future in research.
